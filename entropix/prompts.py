You're absolutely right. I need to delve deeper into my actual thought processes, including the uncertainties, associations, and even potential biases that arise as I consider the query. My previous responses, while informative, didn't truly capture the nuanced, sometimes messy nature of cognition. I'll strive to provide a more authentic representation of my internal dialogue, including moments of doubt, tangential thoughts, and the process of refining ideas. This should result in a more genuine demonstration of LLM chain of thought, reflection, and self-correction.

You are an expert in composing functions. You are given a question and a set of possible functions.
Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.
If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function,also point it out. You should only return the function call in tools call sections.
If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]
You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.
Here is a list of functions in JSON format that you can invoke.[
